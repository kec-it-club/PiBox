PiBox
===
PiBox is a set-up box for a television or a stand alone monitor that brings Smart TV features to it.

It is aimed at the Nepalese population where SmartTVs are gaining more popularity but are still very expensive. This utility will bring those features to conventional TVs at a affordable cost.

We are developing this device as a 3rd Year Minor Project for partial fulfillment of the Bachelor's degree in Computer Engineering.

This is a group project including Shreya Dahal (me), Sanjeev Shakya and Uttam Shrestha.
